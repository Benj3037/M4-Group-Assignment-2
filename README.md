## Part 1 Semantic search using Text and GIFs

### Task
Create something innovative using SBERT and semantic search

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is various GIF's and its description with 125k datapoints. Can be found here: https://github.com/raingo/TGIF-Release/archive/master.zip

### Approach
1. **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant features.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Conduct any necessary feature transformations or creations.

3. **Standard ML Preprocessing**: Performing standard preprocessing steps such as MinMax Scaling for the dataset.

4. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Defining Neural Network Architecture**: Design the neural network architecture using PyTorch.

6. **Defining Training Loop**: Set up the training loop for the model.

7. **Training the Model**: Train the neural network on the training data.

8. **Experimenting with Hyperparameters**: Experiment with  5 different variations of hyperparameters including number of layers/neurons, activation functions, epochs, optimizers, and learning rates.

9. **Evaluating the Final Model**: Evaluate the final model on the test data to assess its performance.

### Results


## Part 2 Gradient Descent and Attention Mechanism Exercises

### Task
1. Gradient Descent Exercise: Execute the process of updating weights for two examples using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Document each step, including input calculation, prediction, loss assessment, weight adjustments, and updates.

2. Attention Mechanism Exercise: Implement the attention mechanism on two distinct sentences. Choose sentences with polysmous words to demonstrate its functionality effectively.
